                In 2023, NGITI funded the building of four new classrooms, three in BCS2 and one in Nailon's school. The classrooms are typhoon-resistant and furnished with desks and chairs for thirty students each. Half of the students will study in the morning, and the other half in the afternoon. Additionally, critical medical equipment, such as mayo stands, an examination light, a CPAP machine, and a baby bassinet, was bought for Bogo Hospital.

                In 2022, Ngiti collaborated with the government to open a neonatology department, supplying key medical equipment to Bogo Hospital. This increased the capacity to care for newborns from 4 to 6. Additionally, Ngiti built a kindergarten class in Gairan School, renovated a Grade 4 class in Nailon, and provided basic school supplies to around 850 children in Bogo, including paper, notebooks, crayons, pens, and pencils for Bogo Central School students.

                In 2021, Ngiti expanded its health initiatives and continued to support education in Bogo.

                  In 2020, Ngiti built two new kindergarten classrooms at Nailon School. When the pandemic halted in-person classes nationwide, Ngiti partnered with the government to provide learning modules to 5000 children across four schools. Ngiti supported this effort by supplying printers, ink, and paper for module printing.

                  Ngiti built a special education class at Bogo Central School 3 for 20 children with disabilities and renovated two kindergarten classes at Bogo Central School 2.

                  Ngiti constructed five classrooms with concrete floors, providing essential furniture such as tables, chairs, and blackboards. This allows for smaller class sizes, enhancing learning opportunities for students. Additionally, Ngiti ensured the provision of school supplies for all students.

                    This year, Ngiti focused on improving basic health conditions at the school. They built seven toilets in BCS3 over two months, reducing health risks such as dengue. Additionally, basic health supplies like toothbrushes and soap were provided. Ngiti also distributed school supplies to all 2500 students.

                  NGITI started this year with the most important - school furniture and school supplies. Most children and families cannot afford school supplies. Thanks to a crowdfunding, the first aim of the association has been fulfilled. Chairs, tables and school supplies were bought. In addition, outdoor games and supplies were purchased to improve the learning environment of the children.
