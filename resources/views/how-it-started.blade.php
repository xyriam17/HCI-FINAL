  <p>In November 2013, Super Typhoon Yolanda hit the Philippines, killing 6,300 people
    in only 8 days. 
  </p>
  <p>
   It is the deadliest typhoon the country had ever experienced to date. 
   A worldwide known NGO, called Projects Abroad, came directly after the typhoon, to rebuild a school, situated in the South of the country, on an island called Cebu.

    "In 2015, I spent two months volunteering in a Kindergarten class at Bogo Central School III, Philippines, with Projects Abroad. [...] Saying that this trip was life-changing barely covers it. Taking care of such generous kids and being able to put a smile on their face made a big difference in the way I see life and made me put things into perspective."

    A year later, they had finished their mission. A lot remained to be done. They had built classrooms but there was little school supplies: children were studying on the floor. Since then, several fundraisings have been launched and NGITI was created in January 2017 - this done to directly benefit the schools, hospital and the children.
